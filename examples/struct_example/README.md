# Struct Example

This example demonstrates how to use structs in GoScript, including:

- Defining struct types
- Creating struct instances
- Defining methods on structs
- Calling struct methods

## Running the Example

```bash
cd examples/struct_example
go run main.go
```

The script creates a Person struct with methods and demonstrates method calls on both value and pointer receivers.
