- if-else statements
- for loops (with initialization, condition, and post statements)
- while-like loops (for loops with only a condition)
- nested loops

## Running the Example

```bash
cd examples/control_flow
go run main.go
```

The script demonstrates various control flow constructs and their usage in GoScript.
