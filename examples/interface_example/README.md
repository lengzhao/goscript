# Interface Example

This example demonstrates how to use interfaces in GoScript, including:

- Defining interface types
- Implementing interfaces with struct types
- Using interface methods

## Running the Example

```bash
cd examples/interface_example
go run main.go
```

The script creates Shape interface and implements it with Rectangle and Circle structs, then calculates the total area.
